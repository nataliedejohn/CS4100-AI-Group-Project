For the project, we used AI to help us understand Deep Q Nets and learned how to use it with the context of our problem. For this, ClaudeAI was utilized. Additionally, copilot was used to help make the
basic structure of the model, in which we were able to expand upon to modify it for our project topic. To select some of the features for the project, we utilized AI to help make the best selections, such as
the players and best features for each of the players. Lastly, some basic understanding of the pybaseball library was generated from ClaudeAI.
